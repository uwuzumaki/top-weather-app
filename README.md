# top-weather-app

A weather app for the odin project.

## Usage

Simply search for the city of your choice and the weather API will return the city with various weather information.

## Future implementations

Adding a button to swap between celcius and farenheit.

Adding images to depict the condtion.

## Issues

The API key for the weather app is stored inside the javascript. The lesson specified not to worry about it as it will be solved in future lessons.

As this project doesn't use a bundler like webpack, I linked the stylesheets separately in the html rather than importing it.
